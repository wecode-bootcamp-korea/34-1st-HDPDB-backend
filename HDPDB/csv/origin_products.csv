A collaboration with world-renowned headphone manufacturer Beyerdynamic, the DT 177X GO has the kind of German-made quality you can see, hear, and feel. Based on the DT 1770 PRO, it uses the latest generation of 45-millimeter Tesla drivers for a wide frequency range and a weighty, controlled bass. We smoothed the response slightly while retaining the punchy sound that’s made the DT 1770 PRO a favorite in recording studios. With 32-ohm impedance, it’s easy to drive from portable sources without an amp, while the office-friendly closed-back design ensures your music won’t disturb your neighbor—and vice versa. The four-pin mini-XLR connection allows compatibility with balanced cables. For unrivaled comfort, you’ll get two pairs of premium Dekoni earpads—one sheepskin and the other velour—totally free.",BEYERDYNAMIC,1

The Liberty 3 Pro carries this torch forward beautifully with an impressive slate of features. The updated ACAA 2.0 driver technology provides rich-sounding, 10.6-millimeter coaxial drivers that focus on punchy, bass-forward frequencies alongside plenty of detail on the upper end. There’s customizable active noise-canceling built in with HearID digital signal processing, which allows for just the right amount of cancellation for your specific ears. Soundcore has also chambered each earphone this time to provide a better, lower-pressure fit for those whose ears are a bit more sensitive to the traditional in-ear feeling. The Liberty 3 Pro ships with a charging battery case that unlocks up to 32 hours of listening time on a single charge— and because it’s chargeable via USB-C or Qi-certified wireless tech, juicing the case back up is easy to do.","SPECS

What's Hi-Profile, you ask? Many computer terminals of old were constructed with a slanted switch layout from front to back. Because of that slant, the keycaps sat at an angle atop the switches, too. This set is a reimagination of that unique slanted build, but optimized for modern keyboards. Thanks to some significant design work from Matt3o, 3D modeling, and a whole lot of elbow grease, we're proud to bring these innovative caps back for a second run.","SPECS
